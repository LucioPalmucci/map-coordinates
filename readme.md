# Map coordinates

A small application that shows coordinates (longitude & latitude) and copies them to the clipboard, making it easier to obtain coordinates for a location.

This application uses [`Leaflet`](https://leafletjs.com/) and [`Leaflet-Geosearch`](https://smeijer.github.io/leaflet-geosearch/) for geolocation search.
